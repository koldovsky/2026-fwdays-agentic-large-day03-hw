# Active Context

See [progress.md](./progress.md) for broader status and [hidden invariants](../technical/hidden-invariants.md) for risky source-grounded behavior notes.

## Current Focus
- Memory Bank now exists and is the primary durable context for the repo.
- Keep Memory Bank compact and non-duplicative, with deep detail living in `docs/technical/*` and `docs/product/*`.

## Recent Changes
- Added context menu architecture documentation in [context-menu-architecture.md](../technical/context-menu-architecture.md), covering the action-based menu system, item registration, predicate filtering, text-specific actions, and extension points. Notably, nested/sub-menus are not supported — the existing `DropdownMenu` subsystem would need to be integrated for that.
- Added deep i18n/multilanguage architecture reference in [i18n-architecture.md](../technical/i18n-architecture.md), covering translation engine, language gating, Crowdin integration, RTL support, and data flow.
- Added the core Memory Bank files under `docs/memory-bank/`.
- Added the deep technical doc [hidden invariants](../technical/hidden-invariants.md) to capture behavior that is easy to miss during future edits.
- Added full architecture reference in [architecture.md](../technical/architecture.md), grounded in source code and focused on data/state/rendering/package relationships.
- Added deep package-focused architecture documentation in [packages-architecture.md](../technical/packages-architecture.md), with a source-grounded analysis of `packages/*`.
- Expanded [hidden invariants](../technical/hidden-invariants.md) with package-level invariants for lifecycle events, store observation, fractional-index sync, and utils export normalization.
- Added contributor onboarding documentation in [dev-setup.md](../technical/dev-setup.md), covering clone/bootstrap, local verification, and first-PR workflow.
- Added a repo-level `AGENTS.md` instructing future sessions to read all Memory Bank markdown files first.
- Audited `docs/memory-bank/` and removed obvious duplicate context so stable architecture stays in [systemPatterns.md](./systemPatterns.md) while deeper caveats live in [hidden invariants](../technical/hidden-invariants.md).
- Validated the `## Commands` section in [techContext.md](./techContext.md) against current root/app package scripts and corrected the `yarn test:app` label.
- Added foundational product documentation in `docs/product/`: baseline PRD, feature catalog, domain glossary, and UX patterns; linked it from [productContext.md](./productContext.md).
- Audited duplication between Memory Bank and deep docs; reduced repeated product/technical detail in Memory Bank files and kept link-based navigation.

## Next Steps
- If this repo is actively customized beyond upstream Excalidraw, document those local deltas explicitly instead of relying on code discovery.
- If contributors need non-default backend/service wiring, add an explicit required-vs-optional env matrix (or `.env.example`) and link it from [dev-setup.md](../technical/dev-setup.md).
- Review new product docs with maintainers and mark advanced features as GA vs experimental where needed.

## Open Questions
- Should [dev-setup.md](../technical/dev-setup.md) be treated as the canonical contributor entrypoint, or should setup details be split into service-specific technical docs?
- It is unclear whether this checkout is meant to track upstream Excalidraw closely or serve as a long-lived custom fork.

## Active Decision Points
- Whether to keep backend/service setup mostly implicit in code defaults, or formalize a strict required-vs-optional env contract for contributors.
- Whether collaboration and persistence need dedicated ADR-style docs beyond the summary kept in [decisinLog.md](./decisinLog.md).

## Validation Notes
- No test suite was run in this documentation update; changes are docs-only.
