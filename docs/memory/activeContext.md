# Active Context: Excalidraw

## Current Version

- **Packages**: v0.18.0 (`@excalidraw/excalidraw`, `@excalidraw/common`, `@excalidraw/element`, `@excalidraw/math`)
- **Utils**: v0.1.2 (`@excalidraw/utils`)
- **App**: v1.0.0

## Recent Architectural Changes

### Package Extraction (Ongoing)

The codebase underwent a major refactoring to extract functionality into separate packages:

- `@excalidraw/common` — shared utilities extracted from main package
- `@excalidraw/element` — element logic separated from UI
- `@excalidraw/math` — math operations isolated

This enables better tree-shaking and independent versioning.

### React 19 Migration

Upgraded to React 19.0.0 with React DOM 19.0.0, taking advantage of:

- Improved concurrent features
- Better Suspense support
- New hooks API refinements

### TypeScript 5.9

Updated to TypeScript 5.9.3 for latest type system features.

## Current Development Focus

1. **Package ecosystem stabilization** — ensuring clean APIs between packages
2. **Performance optimization** — canvas rendering with large element counts
3. **AI integration** — text-to-diagram backend (`VITE_APP_AI_BACKEND`)
4. **Excalidraw Plus** — commercial offering with additional features

## Known Active Issues

- `FAST_REFRESH=false` in dev config (disabled, potentially for stability)
- PWA disabled in development (`VITE_APP_ENABLE_PWA=false`)
- Service Worker debugging requires `VITE_APP_DEV_DISABLE_LIVE_RELOAD`

## Next Steps

- Continue package API refinement
- Improve collaboration reliability
- Expand AI-powered features
- Enhance embeddable component documentation
